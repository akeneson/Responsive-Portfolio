# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The webpage created is a responsive design that ensures that web applications will display on a variety of devices, window, or screen sizes. 

## About the project

 The Bootstrap CSS Framework was used to recreate my portfolio that includes a navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images. The use of Bootstrap's grid system was used to appropriately display webpage data.
